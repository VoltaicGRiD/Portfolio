			Hi — I'm Dustin Conlon, a Full Stack Software Engineer who builds accessible, maintainable, and
			performant web applications. I enjoy working across the stack and shipping features end-to-end,
			from design and frontend implementation to backend APIs and deployment.
		</p>

		<p>
			My work emphasizes pragmatic engineering: I prioritize clear, testable code, fast user
			experiences, and developer ergonomics. I have experience with modern JavaScript and
			TypeScript-based toolchains and frameworks (including Astro, React, and Node.js), CSS and
			a11y best practices, and common cloud and CI/CD workflows.
		</p>

		<h3>Technical highlights</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS</li>
			<li>Frameworks & tooling: Astro, React, Node.js</li>
			<li>Testing & quality: unit and integration testing, linting, accessibility checks</li>
			<li>Infrastructure: Git-based workflows, CI/CD pipelines, deployment to cloud/static hosts</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Experience highlights</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Built and shipped production web applications and content-driven sites.</li>
			<li>Improved performance and accessibility for user-facing interfaces.</li>
			<li>Collaborated with designers, product managers, and engineers to deliver features on time.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Backend & systems</h3>
		<p>
			On the backend I have experience building APIs and services using .NET (C#) and Python. My
			backend work includes designing and implementing RESTful APIs, working with relational and
			non-relational databases, and creating background processing and integration jobs. I'm familiar
			with dependency injection patterns, ORM tools, and writing reliable unit and integration tests
			for server-side code.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>.NET / C#: Web API development, dependency injection, Entity Framework, and deployment to
				cloud hosts.</li>
			<li>Python: scripting, data processing, and building lightweight services and integrations.</li>
			<li>APIs & data: REST design, JSON/HTTP contracts, schema validation, and working with SQL and
				NoSQL databases.</li>
			<li>Operational: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and container-based deployments.</li>
		</ul>
