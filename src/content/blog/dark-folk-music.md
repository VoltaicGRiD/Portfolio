I spend a lot of time with headphones on, and more often than not I’m listening to dark folk. It really all started with *Pacific Drive*, a compelling first-person driving game set in the Olympic Peninsula, developed by **Ironwood Studios**. Alongside its stunning visuals, and a fascinating gameplay loop, it ships with a fantastic, *otherworldly* soundtrack. At first it was just a sound I liked: simple instruments, voices that felt raw instead of polished, a kind of heaviness that was comforting rather than draining. Over time, I realized it wasn’t just background noise. Paired with the anomalous environment, and the gritty-but-gorgeous aesthetic of the game, it was shaping the way I thought about atmosphere and storytelling.

Dark folk songs build slowly. They don’t rush to the chorus, and they don’t try to overwhelm you with volume. Instead, they linger on small details: the scrape of strings, the space between notes, the weight of a single lyric. That patience is something I’ve carried into my own work. Whether I’m writing code, designing a game system, or putting together a Blender scene, I try to leave room for the quiet parts to matter.  

What I love most is the honesty. These songs don’t feel engineered to fit a chart or a playlist. They feel personal, like they were meant to be heard around a fire rather than blasted in a stadium. That intimacy is the same feeling I want to capture when I build something creative. I don’t need it to reach everyone. I just want it to reach the right people, in the right way.  

I’ve noticed that mood carries across mediums. The atmosphere in a song can influence the way I design a world in *Utopia TTRPG*, or the way I texture a scene in Blender. Music isn’t just sound; it’s tone, and tone is what makes a story feel alive.

In the end, dark folk resonates with me because it’s about depth. It’s not afraid to be quiet, or slow, or heavy. And when I sit down to build, that’s the energy I want to bring: something thoughtful, something that lingers, something that feels like it belongs to a larger story.
